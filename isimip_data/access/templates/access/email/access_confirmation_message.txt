Dear ISIMIP data user,

You are receiving this e-mail because you requested access to the resource:

{{ resource.title }}

Click the link below to set the access token in your browser:

{{ token_url }}

Afterwards, you should be able to download the files.

If you want to download the data using a command line tool, you need to set
a specific header which contains your token. E.g.:

wget --header="{{ token.as_header }}" URL

curl -H "{{ token.as_header }}" URL

http --download URL "{{ token.as_header }}"

If you use the requests library in your Python script, you can use:

response = requests.get(url, headers={"Authorization": "Bearer {{ token.as_jwt }}"})

If you encounter any problems, please do not hesitate to contact us at info@isimip.org.

Best wishes,
The ISIMIP data team
