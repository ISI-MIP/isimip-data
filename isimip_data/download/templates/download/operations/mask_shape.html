    You can upload a custom vector mask in <strong>Shapefile or GeoJSON</strong> format,
    which will be converted to a NetCDF mask on the server. You can set the <strong>layer</strong>
    of the uploaded file to be used as mask.
</p>

<p>
    The files are then masked using the command:
    <code>cdo -f nc4c -z zip_5 -ifthen -selname,VAR MASKFILE IFILE OFILE</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Everything outside is set to <code>missing_value</code> and the grid is kept.
