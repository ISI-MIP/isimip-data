    You can upload a custom vector mask in GeoJSON/shapefile format,
    which will be converted to a NetCDF mask on the server. You can set the layer of the uploaded file to be used
    as mask. You can also set a name for the mask file on the server
    (which does not need to match the name of the uploaded file).
</p>

<p>
    The files are then masked using the command:
    <code>cdo -f nc4c -z zip_5 -ifthen -selname,VAR MASKFILE IFILE OFILE</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Everything outside is set to <code>missing_value</code> and the grid is kept.
