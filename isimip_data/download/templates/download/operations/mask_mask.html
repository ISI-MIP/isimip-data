    You can upload a custom <strong>NetCDF</strong> mask which needs to contain at lease one
    <strong>mask variable</strong>, which contains only zeros and ones.
</p>

<p>
    The files are then masked using the command:
    <code>cdo -f nc4c -z zip_5 -ifthen -selname,VAR MASKFILE IFILE OFILE</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Everything outside is set to <code>missing_value</code> and the grid is kept.
